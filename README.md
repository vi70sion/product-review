# ProductReview - Product Reviews Platform

This project is a Product Reviews platform. It allows users to write reviews, rate products, and browse reviews based on categories. It includes a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend using Java Spring Boot with MySQL. The platform also features real-time notifications and performance optimization using Redis caching.
